        <p>
          During my time at KABK, I realised, while others were working
          digitally, I preferred to work with analogue or traditional forms of
          art and hand-woven kilims became a real fascination of mine. Through
          my research, I began to understand how images could tell stories
          that have different interpretations and that there could be hidden
          meanings behind symbols, patterns, and motifs. Having been
          surrounded by intricate handmade patterns throughout my childhood,
          in the form of carpets and kilims, had clearly had an impact on my
          subconscious, helping to generate my attraction to images and
          colour. I wanted to understand what the implications of these
          traditional hand-woven kilims and carpets not being made anymore
          would be and whether there were other ways that could tell the
          stories incorporated into their strands. I wanted to know why, when
          Turkish kilims are so highly valued, the craft is still dying out.

          Turkish carpet weaving is slowly disappearing. In the past, carpets
          would be woven in almost every household but now only few continue
          this tradition. In this essay I will explore the changing nature of
          traditional Aegean village life, particularly for that of women.
          Carpet weaving was their art, their creative outlet, and their
          visual language. It provided another way of connecting them to the
          landscape and a way to earn some money. I hope to discover how they
          tell their stories now. I also want to see if these traditional
          motifs have found a new lease of life in more contemporary and
          decorative arts. If they have, do they still have the same meanings,
          are they still telling stories? I will investigate what will be lost
          if this craft does become a thing of the past. It is my belief that
          there is very little public awareness of the situation, if this is
          true, I hope to find ways to change this and perhaps find ways that
          would help to turn it around.

          Kilim weavers, kilim sellers and local connected businesses will
          constitute my primary sources. I will interview them, both in order
          to gather information and to gain an insight into why they think it
          is in danger of disappearing. The book Kilim, The Complete Guide by
          Alaister Hull and Jose Luczyc-Wyhowska will be my primary source for
          historical references in addition to several different Turkish
          sources. The artwork of Faig Ahmed and the work of textile
          specialist and artist Belkis Balpınar will be my case studies on
          taking traditional skills into the realm of contemporary art. I will
          investigate organisations, such as DOBAG Carpet Initiative, who are
          trying to create awareness of this sad situation. Studying the
          techniques, patterns, meanings, and purpose will go some way to
          elucidate the impact that this craft has had on the Aegean Region.
          Working on a subject that is from my homeland and constitutes a part
          of my cultural heritage is very important to me and it is certainly
          something I would like to include in my future works. I hope that my
          work provides a constructive way to voice this concern about the
          loss of a part of Turkish culture and perhaps generate new ideas of
          how this form of art can continue in the modern world.

        <p>
          Handmade kilims were always part of the décor in our home and the
          homes of family and friends in Türkiye. Some lay on floors, some,
          especially those made of silk, were hung on walls. I never really
          considered them to be anything special or unusual. Growing up I just
          assumed that most people had Turkish kilims in their houses. </p>

        <p>
          Traditional cultural crafts, those that have been around for
          centuries, are dying out in many places. Examples of these are,
          sculpting stone and cotton and silk weaving in India and the art of
          making bagpipes in the UK. There are many reasons for this, not
          least commercialisation and modernisation. Türkiye is also falling
          victim to this, whether it be crafts, old recipes, music, or dance.
          Unfortunately, in this technological era people are looking for
          easier and faster ways to generate products and make money. In the
          Aegean Region the art of Turkish kilim weaving is simply dying out
          as they are being replaced by mass produced machine made
          equivalents. However, they are not equivalent, they no longer retain
          their uniqueness, their specially chosen and naturally dyed colours,
          or their individual stories.
        </p>

        <p>
          The loss of the art of hand-woven kilims in Türkiye is more than
          just a change from handmade to factory made, it is a change that
          particularly affects women and their way of life. As these kilims
          cease to be created by village women, their original identity and
          importance is also lost. They hold a special place in Turkish
          culture as a form of artistic expression but also contain language
          and meaning beyond being solely decorative. Each kilim has its own
          story which is told through its design and motifs. Losing this craft
          risks losing this unique visual language.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div style="background-color: white; color: black">

        <p>
          Another important consideration is how sustainable this craft is and
          how society has become increasingly aware of the need to change. Our
          current way of doing things risks the longevity of the planet as
          well as the loss of many traditional arts, crafts, and expertise.

          <em>“The volume of production in the craft sector has gradually
            decreased over the last century and has been replaced by
            industrial production. The artisan has to compete nationally and
            internationally with products that appear to have been made by
            hand, when in fact they are mass produced.” </em>

          For a long time, I have been interested in the art of weaving but
          after my research into its importance within Turkish culture, I felt
          it was imperative to try and find ways that it could be revived.
          Such a special and complex craft shouldn’t be allowed to die out. I
          believe that understanding the language and significance of the
          motifs will play an important part in this.

        <p>
          ’Etrim Carpet’ is situated in Etrim Village, which is located in
          the Aegean Region of Türkiye. It was founded by Mehmet Başol in
          1981. It is like an Aladdin’s cave of handmade carpets and kilims.
          Here you can watch people weave, see the threads being dyed and
          dried and view a vast collection of kilims and carpets from all
          around Türkiye, which, of course, are also available for purchase.
          When you are there, they want you to experience Turkish
          hospitality at its best and most traditional while they try to
          find you the perfect carpet or kilim suited specifically to your
          taste. Tasty local delicacies are offered as you listen to the
          story behind each woven masterpiece.

          I spoke with Mehmet, and he told me that he had his first group of
          tourists in 1981, he said
          <em>“They were 25 British people. It was so different back then,
            and I was so excited. At that time, I didn't have the buildings
            that are here now, so I set up a pergola and put some cushions
            on the floor, my mum made gözleme, [a type of savoury stuffed
            pancake] and other local delicacies. I sold many carpets that
            day. I made sure that everyone got the carpet of their dreams.”

          Mehmet has kept his business going with the same passion and
          enthusiasm but is saddened by the craft’s slow decline. He has
          been trying to find ways to save this craft but isn’t getting the
          support he needs. I am in awe of this special place and delighted
          by the fact that it is possible to watch the weavers at work and
          ask them questions. Everyone working there is so welcoming. Every
          year, when my English family come to visit us, we go to Etrim
          because it is such a lovely experience. The local village food is
          cooked on an open fire while you sit in the garden amongst the
          wonderful smelling pine trees looking at beautiful carpets and
          kilims. My English was always impressed by the rich ancient
          culture, and she also loved Turkish kilims. She bought her own
          carpet from Etrim Carpet. She was so happy with her carpet, she
          said <em>‘it has transformed my living room, it’s like a deep red jewel
          glowing next to my fireplace.’</em>

        <p>
          There is a lot that goes into making a hand-woven kilim, which is
          part of what makes it so special. The process of creating a kilim
          begins long before the weaving. Firstly, the colours are chosen, and
          then the flowers, leaves, fruits, or plants, that create the dyes
          for the chosen colours, are picked. The dyes are all produced from
          local plants. For example, in the Milas area, peach, hibiscus, sage,
          walnut and mint leaves were used frequently. As Mehmet Başol told me
          that <em>“There was a man who would come to dye all the threads, but he
          kept his technique a secret. He would make different batches of
          colours for each weaver and then leave. It was all so mysterious
          and none of us could replicate it. Every single colour was %100
          natural made from leaves and plants.”</em>

        <p>
          The fleeces used for the wool would have been washed by driving the
          flock of sheep into a stream. They were washed repeatedly until the
          desired content of natural oil remained. After this, the wool was
          “carded” to align the fibres and then spun, a laborious task that
          was often taken on by the whole community. Every single skein of
          wool was dyed and spun by hand. After the dying process the looms
          were prepared, and the designs formulated. The designs weren’t
          sketched, they were all just in the minds of their creators. Once
          begun they would weave every day, usually first thing in the morning
          and again later in the evening.
        </p>

        <p>
          Depending on the size, a kilim would usually take between one and
          three months to complete. Every colour, pattern and material used
          was always chosen specifically in order to create a unique piece.
          Attention was paid to using quality materials [the best wool or
          silk] as it was important to make something that would last for a
          very long time. It is said that due to the natural qualities of the
          lanolin in the wool the colours used in these kilims often become
          richer as the years go by. It is clear that the process behind the
          production of hand-woven kilims is very much sustainable as every
          part of the process is completed by hand.

          My mum moved to Türkiye in 1997, and she has been fascinated by
          Turkish kilims ever since. Her passion for them clearly had a
          lasting impact on me. Being an artist, she was drawn to the vibrant
          colours, textures, and compositions of these kilims. I remember
          visiting village weavers and kilim shops with her. I remember
          thinking that these huge buildings filled with kilims were magical
          and I was sure there must have been some flying carpets in there
          somewhere. My mum always said that kilims <em>‘gave her immense joy,
          the sumptuous colours, the beautiful designs, that they captured a part
          of history, a sense of the exotic and mystique of a different culture.’</em>

        <p>
          Originally Turkish kilims were made out of necessity; they were used
          as part of a shelter, they were placed over the floor and on the
          walls of tents as insulation. Historically the Turks were nomadic
          people, so kilims were ideal for their way of life as they could be
          easily rolled up and transported to their next destination.</p>

        <p> The kilims were also used to keep their camels warm in winter or to
          protect them from the harsh sun in the summer. They were also used
          to cover coffins before a burial. <em>“Kilims were woven for use by the
            family and the women would keep one specifically for her funeral which
            would be placed on the coffin and then donated to the mosque.”</em>

          Traditionally, kilims were made for their own needs, but any excess
          wool would be spun to make extra kilims and bags which would, be
          used as currency in exchange for essential items, contracts for
          irrigation, land, and marriage. In fact, they became an essential
          part of a wedding dowry. The kilims were woven to a high standard as
          it was a way for a woman to show her commitment and potential
          earning power to any prospective husband.
        </p>

        <p>
          In my research question I asked if hand weaving kilims could remain
          socially and artistically viable considering the current drive
          towards sustainable living. As I mentioned above, all these
          hand-woven carpets are made locally from local plants and wool and
          they provide work for the locals, especially for women, which
          certainly suggests sustainability. They also generate a setting for
          social bonding and an outlet for personal expression. According to
          Feryal Söylemezoğlu, Ankara University Department of Handicrafts,
          <em>“members of farming families have frequently been involved in
            handicrafts and carpet weaving… in the wintertime and in bad rainy
            weather it is an additional income. This is of great consequence
            for rural development.”</em>
          <a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a>

      <div style="background-color: white; color: black">

        <p>
          Handwoven carpets are indeed a sustainable product. The start-up
          costs are negligible- a basic loom, a knife, and a pair of scissors
          all set up at home which avoids any additional workshop expenses.
          Fleeces are hand shorn, the yarn is spun and dyed by hand with
          organic natural dyes made from local fauna. By avoiding the use of
          synthetic materials and chemical dyes the local environment is being
          preserved and the earth’s dwindling natural resources, in terms of
          fossil fuels, are not being used. Additionally, only locally grown
          plants and materials are used making it even more environmentally
          friendly. It is clear to see that the hand weaving of kilims is
          socially, culturally, and environmentally sustainable, something
          that many now consider important when purchasing new items.

          <em>“In recent decades there has been a resurgence of crafts and
            artisans’ processes as new markets have emerged, particularly
            among urban consumers who attribute ethical, environmental and
            socio-cultural value to crafts.”</em>

          I am sure these carpets could be promoted on a much larger scale
          with an emphasis on their sustainability, paying particular
          attention to their ethical, environmental, and socio-cultural value
          which would attract the attention of the aforementioned market.
          However, my research did suggest that there remained some doubt as
          to whether producing handmade carpets could remain socially and
          economically viable for the villagers involved.

        <h2 style="color: #830E2B;">Weaving, Women, and Commercialism</h2>
        <p>
          Weaving has played a large part in the heritage and culture of women
          in Türkiye. Passed down from generation to generation, it has
          provided a way for them to show the world their creative skills and
          how a piece of art can also be a functional part of daily life.<em>
          “There were often two looms in every village household, and
          everyone could weave. The children and husbands would help, but
          things have changed, people don’t want to weave anymore.”</em>
          <a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a>




          Girls learnt how to weave at a young age, from their mother and
          grandmother and would continue weaving throughout their lives.
          <em>“We started learning at the age of 6 and had completed our
            training by the age of 10. My mother used to tell me to help her
            so we could finish the kilim as quickly as possible. By the age of
            15 we were able to finish a whole kilim by ourselves.”</em>
          <a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a>

        <p>
          In the villages in the Aegean region women didn’t go out to work,
          instead they would look after their families, tend their animals,
          work in the fields, sew and weave kilims. Therefore, weaving these
          kilims has always been a part of their daily routine. It gave them
          purpose, a way to earn a living and to express themselves
          creatively. When I was visiting these villages one of the weavers
          told me,
          <em>“We are so sad because our art used to be so important and was
            appreciated by so many worldwide and now, it seems that it has all
            been lost.”</em>
        </p>

        <p>
          This skilled, creative work allowed women to elevate their position
          in society as they were no longer just a mother or a tender of
          livestock. Unfortunately, in these villages, women didn’t have a
          public voice, they weren’t allowed to have an opinion outside of
          their own home and certainly wouldn’t publicly express their
          feelings. In place of this, over the years as they were weaving,
          they made up their own language through the patterns and motifs on
          the kilims. Each kilim tells the story of its maker which meant that
          these women always had a special bond with every one of their
          creations.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div style="background-color: white; color: black">

        <p>
          None of these women had art lessons or studied art but have managed
          to create these wonderful pieces of art solely through their own
          imagination. Being handmade every single kilim is absolutely unique.
          Turkish kilims seem symmetrical at first, however, after speaking to
          one of the weavers on one of my visits to Etrim, I was told that
          <em>“everything, at first glance, seems symmetrical, but we always
            make sure that there is one mistake because only God can create
            perfection”</em> from this we can identify that religion was also
          very important to those weaving the carpets.
        </p>



        <p>
          <em>“I always tell people, weaving kilims is a difficult job, it
            requires a lot of effort, but at the end of the day, it is worth
            it. I am still amazed at the kilims that people produce.
            <em>[shows a kilim]</em> Look at this beauty, look at the
            materials used, look at the dignity it holds, look at the colours
            a person made it over months, not a machine. It's like silk, it's
            so beautiful, it's nearly 100 years old and it's still
            perfect.”</em> I felt a real sense of pride when Mehmet talked about the dignity of
          the work the women produced.

        <p>
          Nowadays, the women generally have no interest in continuing these
          traditional crafts as they usually entail a lot of hard work for a
          very small financial reward. Unfortunately, most of the younger
          generations who live in the villages, now want to leave, and move to
          the nearby towns and cities, where they hope to study and work for
          regular salaries. The dowry, while still a part of many marriage
          contracts, no longer include kilims or carpets. They have been
          replaced by televisions, white goods, and modern furniture.
        </p>

        <p>
          Due to a high demand, mainly from the Western tourists visiting
          Türkiye, the production of kilims changed during the 80’s becoming a
          far more commercial activity. To generate more at cheaper prices,
          natural dyes were replaced with synthetic ones, often leading to
          much brighter colours which also look synthetic. Hand-spun wool was
          replaced by machine spun which led to the wool losing its natural
          oil content, so grease had to be added which didn’t have the same
          qualities as the natural lanolin. Generally, kilims were copied from
          a popular design, so the designs no longer told a story.
        </p>

        <p>
          The village kilim weaver became obsolete as the handmade kilims were
          less profitable and far more time consuming. If the art of
          hand-woven kilims disappears completely, I feel like I would lose an
          important part of my cultural heritage unique to Türkiye and to
          Turkish women. The loss of the 2-dimensional imagery that convey
          their hopes and beliefs. It shouldn’t be allowed to just disappear,
          it’s too important and should be recognised as part of the
          liberation of Turkish women.

        <h2 style="color: #1458DF;">Design and Motifs</h2>

        <p>
          I assumed my attraction to these hand-woven kilims to be linked to
          the decorative motifs and colours. Turkish kilim designs are often
          made up of decorative motifs arranged symmetrically to create an
          aesthetic design. The more I researched and studied the designs the
          more I became aware that the symmetry and ordered arrangement was
          frequently repeated, and that this was perhaps one of the reasons
          why the designs are so widely appreciated. In ‘The sense of Order: a
          study in the Psychology of Decorative Art’ E.H. Gombrich argues that
          humans seek
          <em>‘a sense of order not because nature is generally orderly, but
            rather because perception requires a framework against which to
            plot deviation from regularity.’</em>
          <a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a>
          N.K. Humphreys Director of Research of Animal Behaviour, Cambridge
          University summarises Gombrich’s theory as
          <em> ‘Humans and animals have an innate sense of order and that they
            find order relaxing and pleasing, and a mild degree of disorder
            interesting.’</em>
          <a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a>
        </p>
      </div>

      <div style="background-color: white; color: black">
        <p>
          In a paper on the Sense of Order, DN Perkins of Harvard University
          analyses in detail some of the theories put forward by Gombrich, in
          particular <em>‘the field of force’ which concerns arrangements with a centre
          and a decorative border.’</em>
          <a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a>
          Immediately I thought of Kilim and traditional carpet designs.
          Gombrich, according to Perkins, says that
          <em>“decorative arrangements with a centre and a decorative border
            have two effects; those things (motifs) constituting a design in
            the border tend to lose their individual qualities and to direct
            attention towards centre, those things in the centre tend to have
            their individual qualities emphasised."</em> <a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"
                                                            role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a>
          Gombridge explains this by describing a cake decorated with
          cherries. The cherries around the rim seem less appetising, more of
          a frame. However, <em>‘the cherry in the centre of the cake is very much a
          cherry'</em>
          EH Gombridge. I could see the connection with many kilim and carpet
          designs where there is a border, often within another border,
          surrounding a central arrangement of motifs that immediately attract
          your attention.

      </div>

      <div style="background-color: white; color: black">
        <p>
          Understanding that part of the attraction was because of the
          symmetry and arrangement of the design I then wanted to understand
          the significance of the different ornamentation used in the designs.
          According to the American Institute of Graphic Arts, graphic design
          is <em>’the art and practice of planning and projecting ideas and
          experiences with visual and textual content’</em>
          The textual context of the carpets isn’t apparent at first but is
          found in the arrangement and juxtaposition of the motifs.

      </div>


      <div style="background-color: white; color: black">

        <p>
          Turkish kilim designs are often made up of decorative motifs. The
          motifs used can vary widely depending on the region and cultural
          traditions, but each motif has a symbolic meaning or story or a
          particular message. For example,
          <em>“In the past, when girls in our village fell in love with
            someone, they couldn’t just tell their family. Instead, she would
            weave certain patterns into her carpet. When her parents saw the
            carpet, they would know that she wanted to marry.”</em> <a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"
                                                                       role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a>
        </p>


        <p>
          Some motifs are not restricted to a certain area but are understood
          across the country
          <em>"Su yolu. Without water there is no life, so this is a very
            important motif that is often found incorporated into border
            designs and represents life itself.”</em>

          Other commonly used motifs include symbols representing birth,
          death, abundance, power, motherhood, and family. For example, the
          “Eli Belinde” motif is a symbol of motherhood, so women who were
          ready to have a child would use this symbol in their carpets.
          <em>“I travelled widely during 1980-1990 visiting many villages all

            depiction. Monotheistic religions frequently use this symbol, and
            it is interesting to note that kilims with this design, when hung
            in a village home, are often hung upside down. This practice
            illustrates the fact that it is believed that the roots of the
            tree are in heaven, the source of all power, which are then
            transposed to earth by way of the branches.”</em> </em> <a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"

          The carpets woven in Etrim use a more region specific motif known as

          There are kilims that have been made specifically as prayer mats and
          since the 13th century the motifs used can also be seen replicated
          in mosques or on the tiles of mosques. The geometric Islamic motifs
          hold significant symbolism related to God and transcending life,
          symbolizing the infinite.

          My research into motifs has led me to better understand their
          significance, both within Turkish culture and within the stories of
          the weavers. There is a need to keep these motifs alive because they
          represent a part of Turkish culture and understanding of their art.
          Faig Ahmed an artist from Azerbaijan, and his work is a great
          example of how a traditional craft like carpet weaving can be
          transformed into something new and innovative. By experimenting with
          digital images and 3D design, he is able to break away from
          traditional forms and create something entirely unique. Ahmed is
          fascinated by carpets, how they are woven, their patterns and their
          purpose so he decided to use this in his work.
          <em>“His works re-imagine ancient crafts and create new visual
            boundaries by deconstructing traditions and stereotypes.”</em>
          <a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18" role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a>
          He is able to demonstrate how the meaning and purpose of a craft can
          evolve over time. Ahmed's work is a great reminder of the importance
          of creativity and experimentation to keep traditional crafts alive
          and relevant and how they can be taken to another level. He shows
          how

          All Faig’s carpets consist of one half being made using the

          something completely different according to his own design. They are
          very intriguing pieces of art. Faig still works with weavers from
          his home country which gives those women an income and a way to be a
          part of something contemporary that still relates to their cultural

          Another artist working with weaving and carpets is Belkis Balpinar
          an artist born in Eskisehir, Türkiye. Belkis is a writer, textile
          artist and researcher. In 1986 Belkis started to make her own kilims
          using her own style which then became known as “Artkilim.” Her
          mission was to create modern minimalist kilims that still use the
          traditional weaving techniques. She also only uses naturally dyed
          thread. Her insistence on using naturally dyed threads and the
          traditional weaving process goes some way to help ensure that the
          knowledge and skills related to the traditional process are not
          lost. She, like Faig, also proves what can be achieved by pushing
          the boundaries of the traditional. Belkis uses huge spirals on her
          pieces
          <em>“Kilims are always so flat, motifs are just scattered around and
            then there is a border around the border creating a boundary to
            the rectangle. I decided to get rid of all these borders and
            started to make huge spirals”</em>
          <a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20" role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a>

          She goes on to say that
          <em>“While the kilim motifs have been transferred from mother to
            daughter for centuries, they matured with very minor changes over
            time. Although I have used the kilim weaving technique, as an
            artist, I broke away from the traditional patterns and motifs
            creating a completely new form of art by leaving unwoven sections
            that give artkilim its multi-dimensional quality.”</em>

          Belkis is artistically challenging the idea of traditional weaving.
          She adapts this ancient process and makes it her own. The craft is
          still alive but in a different form. It doesn’t have quite the same
          social implications as in the villages, but she has worked with one
          traditional weaver for many years.
          <em>“I’m so thankful to one weaver we literally trained each other,

          However, unlike in the villages, her designs are her own, they are
          not traditional motifs that have a meaning, and they are being
          executed by other people rather than just uniquely by her telling
          her own story.

        <p>
          Looking back at my own projects, I have always tried to keep to the
          traditional techniques but then add on my own style. An example of
          this is when I decided to make some traditional Turkish dishes but
          then, like Faig and Belkis, I wanted to provoke a reaction by adding
          crazy food colouring. Turkish people are very proud of their food
          and cook in a very traditional manner. It generally consists of very
          simple cooking using fresh seasonal ingredients. Turkish cooking is,
          generally, not open to new ingredients or methods and this was no
          exception as it was not received well.

        <p>
          Preservation of traditional crafts is so important for our
          cultural heritage and for the skilled craftspeople. The Natural
          Dye Research and Development Project (DOBAG) is one initiative
          which is doing this successfully. Their goal is to revive
          traditional weaving and support rural communities. Their carpets
          use natural dyes and hand-spun wool which create high quality
          kilims. They pay women in rural areas to do the work, ensuring
          that those involved in keeping the tradition alive are able to
          make a living. They get paid per knot and receive a bonus on
          completion of a carpet or kilim. Not only ensuring the
          continuation of traditional crafts this project also supports and
          sustains rural communities. I really hope this scheme is expanded
          to many other areas of Türkiye and neighbouring countries giving
          women a chance to stay in their villages and be able to earn a
          fair wage. As a graphic designer I would happily volunteer for
          this kind of organisation to help promote and develop their
          initiative. Their scheme has led to similar projects in other
          countries that support carpet weavers in Afghanistan and Tibet.
          The cultural survival Ersari Turkmen Project supports Afghan
          refugees. Barakat, Inc. is a non-profit organisation providing
          basic education and medical care to Afghan refugees. The Survival
          Tibetan project supports Tibetans and their traditions. One other
          organisation working to keep cultural crafts alive is UNESCO they
          use a wide range of strategies and initiatives. They have many
          training programmes which ensure passing skills on to younger
          generation. They do a lot of documentation, workshops, conferences
          based on the craft. Most importantly they promote these crafts
          worldwide for people to have more awareness. These are all very
          positive and encouraging projects but there need to be many more
          started in order to make a real difference.

        <p>
          It’s great to see modern artists taking on this traditional craft
          and not only promoting it but taking it to new contemporary levels
          meaning it will reach wider audiences. Hopefully they will inspire
          other artists to do the same. It is also really encouraging to see
          organisations like DOBAG creating such innovative projects that both
          support the tradition itself and the local skilled craftspeople.

          Mehmet of Etrim Carpet, said he wants to start a school devoted to
          teaching these traditional arts, he said,
          <em>“We have thought seriously about starting a school, but we need
            financial support from either the government or private enterprise
            in order to make this a reality.”</em>
          <a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23" role="doc-noteref"><sup>23</sup></a>
        </p>

        <p>
          However, if there is no investment from the government or private
          organisations, in the proposed initiatives that are trying to
          preserve these traditions, there is every indication that this craft
          will gradually disappear, or the carpets and kilims produced will
          become so expensive and exclusive that only the very rich will be
          able to afford them.
        </p>

        <p>
          My research question raised two concerns of mine, the impact on
          Turkish cultural heritage if this craft disappears and could it be
          encouraged and revived in light of its sustainability. I think both
          are issues that are currently ongoing and are being explored by
          artists and different organisations.
